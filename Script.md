INT. KITCHEN – MED SHOT of Chef
Chef:
Hallo and welcome to my cooking show.
Today we are taking a look at eggs. I will show you multiple ways to prepare them and give you some lifehack tips.
Let’s get right into it with our first way of preparing eggs: soft-boiled.
	TITLE CARD: “Soft-boiled eggs”.
	
INT. KITCHEN – CLOSE UP ON KITCHEN SURFACE WITH INGREDIENTS
	Voice-over:
For boiling eggs, we don’t need anything other than eggs.
To kickstart our boiling water we can use a water cooker. These things usually heat up the water way faster than any pan can. A bonus to this is that your water is essentially already cooking so you can put your eggs in an empty pan and add the boiling water.
This way you don’t have to worry about the eggshell cracking when you drop them in the water.
Now we are going to let it sit for about 4 to 6 minutes, depending the size of your egg, to get a nice soft-boiled egg.
If you want a hardboiled egg you can let it sit for another 4 minutes, for a total of 8 minutes. And that will give you a perfectly hardboiled egg.
Now once when we hit our time mark take the pan off the stove and pour the hot water out.
To make it easier to peel the egg we are going to add some cold water. Just fill and empty up the pot a couple of times. That will do the trick.
The cold water should have made our egg easier to peel. After we are done peeling, we can move on to the cross-section of this deliciously soft-boiled egg.
And just like that we have the perfect soft-boiled egg.

TITLE CARD: “Pouched Eggs”.
	Voice over:
Next up in this video I will show you how to pouch an egg.
We are going to start with cracking open an egg in a sieve.
The reason we are using a sieve here is to minimize the white strings that develop most of the time.
When we feel like most of the watery substance is gone we gently drop the egg in the water. For our pouching water we will use water that is just under the boiling temperature to make sure that the boiling doesn’t mess with the shape of our egg. 
Gently stir the water to make the egg get its signature pouched egg shape. 
Once we’re happy with the egg we can take it out. 
And now for the cross-section we’ve all been waiting for.
I hope you learned something from this video. Thanks for watching!
