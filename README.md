# Multimedia Video Assignment
For this assignment I have created a how-to style cooking video with lifehacks.

## Research
For my insperation I used youtube to find cooking video's.
The greatest inspiration I got from:
- Binging with Babish - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJHA_jMfCvEnv-3kRjTCQXw
- Barry Lewis - https://www.youtube.com/user/myvirginkitchen
- You Suck At Cooking - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w
- Bon Appetit - https://www.youtube.com/user/BonAppetitDotCom
  
  
  ## Tools Used
  I used the following tools to create my video.
  
  **Adobe After Effects CC**
  
  I used After Effects to create the video I made. I tried to work with Davinci Resolve first but that kept crashing, most likely because I couldn't use hardware acceleration on the Polytech computer that I used.
  
  I have added screenshots to show that I used colour correction, proficient assest management and my usage of the timeline.
  
  
  **Adobe Media Encode CC**
  
  Adobe Media Encode is used to encode the After Effects project into a fully fledged video.

  **YouTube Studio**
  
  I used YouTube Studio to upload my video.

  ## Equipment
  All video was shot on a Samsung Galaxy S7 in Full HD (1920x1080 pixels).
  
  A tripod was used to stabalize the shots.

I have added some [screenshots](/Screenshots) to show my proficiency with the tools that I used.
